                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Synchrotron X-ray emission from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is a sensitive probe of its magnetic field and high-energy particle population. Here we analyze contemporaneous NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the PWN G54.1+0.3, powered by pulsar PSR J1930+1852. We also present a preliminary timing analysis of the central pulsar PSR J1930+1852 and analyze its X-ray pulse profiles in different energy bands. We detect X-ray emission from the combined pulsar and PWN system up to $\approx70$ keV, while emission from the PWN itself has been detected up to $\approx30$ keV, with a photon index $Γ$ increasing from $\sim 1.9$ to $\sim 2.4$ with photon energy between 3 and 30 keV. PWN G54.1+0.3's X-ray spectrum is consistent with a broken power law, with break energy $E_{\rm break} \approx 5$ keV, consistent with synchrotron cooling of a single power-law particle spectrum. The best-fit broadband spectral energy distribution model after the inclusion of this new spectral data indicates a maximum particle $E_{\rm max} \sim 400$ TeV. We discuss PSR J1930+1852 and PWN G54.1+0.3 in the context of other PWNe powered by young energetic pulsars.</p>

We find the Vela-X PWN can be best characterized using two extended components: a large radial Gaussian accompanied by an off-set, compact radial disk, both with a similar spectral index, Γ\sim 2.3. The common spectral properties support a common PWN origin, but a supernova remnant component is plausible for the compact radial disk. With an updated Vela-X model, the phase resolved spectral properties of the Vela pulsar are explored through a phase-resolved analysis. The phase-resolved spectral properties of the pulsar are presented, such as the SED peak energy E$_p$, the width of the SED at its peak, d$_p$, and the asymptotic (low-energy) spectral index, $Γ_0$, are presented. The best-fit spectral models for each LAT pulse peak (Peak 1 and Peak 2) are extrapolated to UV energies and compared to archival, phase-resolved spectra at UV, X-ray, soft γ-ray and TeV energies.

Recent measurements of cosmic rays with the CALET and the DAMPE experiments have revealed a bump-like new feature in the proton and helium spectra in the energy range of ~ (1-100) TeV/nucleon. The origin of the feature is not clearly understood. In this paper, considering an improved and more detailed analysis than previous works, and using an updated age and distance estimates of nearby supernova remnants along with an energy-dependent escape process for cosmic rays from the remnants, we show that the spectral bump can be explained by the contribution of cosmic rays from the nearby supernova remnants, in particular, the Vela remnant. We also show that the contribution from the nearby remnants agrees well with the observed spectra of the heavier cosmic-ray elements from carbon to iron as well as with the measured all-particle cosmic-ray spectrum beyond the knee region when combined with a background flux of cosmic rays originating from distant supernova remnants.</p>

Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found three extended sources with different photon spectra in this region, which will label as SrcA, SrcB and SrcC. Among them, the $γ$-ray source SrcA with a log-parabola spectrum is spatially coincident with a star-forming region and several OB stars. The power-law spectra source SrcB is spatially coincident with a SNR radio shell. SrcC with a harder power-law photon spectrum is located outside of the radio shell structure. All of them are spatially coincident with a dense molecular cloud (MC) in the velocity range of 35 - 54 km s$^{-1}$. In this scenario, SrcB can be interpreted as the GeV counterpart of the SNR, and its $γ$-ray emission originates from the shock-cloud interaction. SrcA and SrcC originate from the escaped CRs illuminating nearby MC. For SrcA, another possibility is that the $γ$-ray emission originates from a young stellar cluster (YSC) associated with a star-forming region (SFR), however, the supporting evidence remains insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">An increasing number of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are being identified in the TeV band by ground-based Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes such that they constitute the dominant source class of Galactic TeV emitters. However, MeV-GeV PWN counterparts are still largely lacking. To date, only a dozen PWNe are identified by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the MeV-GeV band. Most PWNe are located along the Galactic plane embedded within the prominent, diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission, which makes these sources difficult to disentangle from the bright diffuse background. We present a systematic search for gamma-ray counterparts to known PWNe in the 300MeV-2TeV energy band using the Fermi-LAT. We target locations of previously identified PWNe that lack detected Fermi-LAT pulsars to minimize associated pulsar contamination. The sample includes 6 previously identified Fermi-LAT PWNe and 8 Fermi-LAT sources associated with PWNe. We report the analysis of 58 regions of interest and classify detected sources as either a likely PWN or a candidate PWN counterpart based on their morphological and spectral characteristics across the broadband spectrum. There are 9 unidentified Fermi-LAT sources that we consider as likely PWN counterparts, which, if confirmed to be PWNe, would greatly increase the PWN population detected by the Fermi-LAT from 12 to 21.

However, MeV-GeV PWN counterparts are still largely lacking. To date, only a dozen PWNe are identified by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the MeV-GeV band. Most PWNe are located along the Galactic plane embedded within the prominent, diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission, which makes these sources difficult to disentangle from the bright diffuse background. We present a systematic search for gamma-ray counterparts to known PWNe in the 300MeV-2TeV energy band using the Fermi-LAT. We target locations of previously identified PWNe that lack detected Fermi-LAT pulsars to minimize associated pulsar contamination. The sample includes 6 previously identified Fermi-LAT PWNe and 8 Fermi-LAT sources associated with PWNe. We report the analysis of 58 regions of interest and classify detected sources as either a likely PWN or a candidate PWN counterpart based on their morphological and spectral characteristics across the broadband spectrum. There are 9 unidentified Fermi-LAT sources that we consider as likely PWN counterparts, which, if confirmed to be PWNe, would greatly increase the PWN population detected by the Fermi-LAT from 12 to 21. The remaining Fermi-LAT detected sources are considered weaker PWN candidates. A second approach in the systematic search for gamma-ray emitting PWNe will involve studying the off-pulse phases of Fermi-LAT pulsars for the presence of an obscured PWN and will be reported in a subsequent paper.`)" title="Add to Reading List">

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">We present an analysis of the optical and near-infrared properties of SN 2022lxg, a bright ($\rm M_{g\, \mathrm{peak}}=-19.41$ mag) and rapidly evolving SN. It was discovered within a day of explosion, and rose to peak brightness in 10 d. Two distinct phases of circumstellar interaction are evident in the data. The first is marked by a steep blue continuum (T $>15,000$ K) with flash-ionisation features due to hydrogen and He II. The second, weaker phase is marked by a change in the colour evolution accompanied by changes in the shapes and velocities of the spectral line profiles. Narrow P-Cygni profiles (~ $150$ km s$^{-1}$) of He I further indicate the presence of slow-moving unshocked material and suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. The fast decline of the light curve from peak (3.48$\pm$ 0.26 mag $\rm (50\,d)^{-1}$ in $g$-band) implies that the ejecta mass must be low. Spectroscopically, until $+35$ d there are similarities to some Type IIb SNe but then there is a transition to spectra that are more reminiscent of an interacting SN II. However, metal lines are largely absent in the spectra, even at epochs of 80 d. Its remote location from the presumed host galaxy, a dwarf with $\rm M_B$ ~ $-14.4$ mag, is consistent with our metallicity estimate - close to the SMC value - obtained from scaling relations. Furthermore, several lines of evidence (including intrinsic polarisation of $p$ ~ (0.5-1.0) %) point to deviations from spherical symmetry. We suggest that a plausible way of uniting the observational clues is to consider a binary system that underwent case C mass transfer. This failed to remove the entire H-envelope of the progenitor before it underwent core-collapse. In this scenario, the progenitor itself would be more compact and perhaps straddle the boundary between blue and yellow supergiants, tying in with the early spectroscopic similarity to Type IIb SNe.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">We consider the question of whether core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can produce rapid neutron capture process (r-process) elements and how future MeV gamma-ray observations could address this. Rare types of CCSNe characterized by substantial magnetic fields and rotation, known as magnetorotational supernovae (MR-SNe), are theoretically predicted to produce these elements, although direct observational evidence is lacking. We suggest that this critical question be addressed through the study of some of the eleven CCSN remnants located within 10 kpc, as well as through the detection of gamma-ray emission from a future Galactic supernova. We use a two-dimensional MR-SN model to estimate the expected gamma flux stemming from nuclear decays in the range of a few tens of keV to a few MeV. Our results indicate that an observation of Sn-126 (Sb-126) in a remnant stands out as a signature of an r-process-producing supernova. Since the neutron-rich conditions that lead to the production of the r-process could also enhance the production of Fe-60, the detection of substantial Fe-60 (Co-60) would be indicative of favorable conditions for the r-process. In the case of a future supernova explosion, when the evolution of the spectrum is studied over ten days to a few years, a rich picture emerges. At various epochs, second peak r-process isotopes such as Sb-125, I-131, Te-132, I-132 and La-140 produce gamma-ray signals that emerge above the background from explosive burning products and electron-positron annihilation. The weak r-process isotopes Nb-95, Ru-103, Rh-106 also have periods of prominence. While MR-SNe are predicted to have a relatively small main r-process contribution, third peak isotopes like Ir-194 could still be above next-generation MeV gamma instrument sensitivities.</p>

With its unprecedented depth, the LSST will survey the southern hemisphere sky, generating nearly 32 trillion observations over its nominal 10-year operation. Among these, approximately 10 million will be supernovae (SNe). These observations will uniquely characterize the SN population, enabling studies of known and rare SN types, detailed parameterization of their light curves, deep searches for new SN progenitor populations, the discovery of strongly lensed SNe, and the compilation of a large, well-characterized sample of superluminous SNe. We analyzed a sample of 22663 simulations of LSST light curves for core collapse SNe (CCSNe), modeled using the radiative transfer code STELLA. We analyzed this dataset with the software CASTOR, which enables the reconstruction of synthetic light curves and spectra via a machine learning technique that allows one to retrieve the complete parameter map of a SN. For each parameter we compared the observed and the true values, determining how LSST light curves alone will contribute to characterize the progenitor and the explosion. Our results indicate that LSST alone will not suffice for a comprehensive and precise characterization of progenitor properties and explosion parameters. The limited spectral coverage of LSST light curves (in most cases) does not allow for the accurate estimation of bolometric luminosity, and consequently, of the explosion energy and nickel yield. Additionally, the redshift-absorption degeneracy is difficult to resolve without supplementary information. These findings suggest that for the most interesting SNe, complementary follow-up observations using spectrographs and optical facilities (particularly in the infrared bands) will be essential for accurate parameter determination.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), being a nearby and actively star-forming satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an ideal site to observe the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy across the electromagnetic spectrum. We aim to exploit the available SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey data to study the distribution, composition and properties of the diffuse X-ray emitting hot gas in the LMC. We construct multi-band X-ray images of the LMC, reflecting the morphology and temperatures of the diffuse hot gas. By performing spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of 175 regions, we constrain the distribution, physical state, and composition of the hot ISM phase throughout the LMC. We combine our constraints with multiwavelength data to obtain a comprehensive view of the different ISM phases. We measure a total X-ray luminosity of the hot ISM phase of $1.9\times10^{38}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ ($0.2-5.0\,\mathrm{keV}$ band), and constrain its thermal energy to around $5\times10^{54}\,\mathrm{erg}$. The typical density and temperature of the X-ray emitting plasma are around $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $0.25\,\mathrm{keV}$, respectively, with both exhibiting broad peaks in the southeast of the LMC. The observed degree of X-ray absorption correlates strongly with the distribution of foreground HI gas, whereas a spatial anticorrelation between the hot and cold ISM phases is visible on sub-kpc scales within the disk. The abundances of light metals show a strong gradient throughout the LMC, with the north and east exhibiting a strong $α$-enhancement, as expected from observed massive stellar populations there. In contrast, the enigmatic ``X-ray spur'' exhibits a local deficit in $α$-elements, and a peak in hot-gas pressure at $P/k\sim10^5\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$, consistent with a dominant energy input through tidally driven gas collisions.</p>

We observe a bright H$α$ shell indicating significant cooling over the remnant, but also an excess of [Oiii] on the eastern shock front. We investigate several theoretical scenarios to explain the emission and radio evolution of J0450.4-7050 in the context of the LMC environment, and determine that this is most likely an older, predominantly radiative, SNR with a higher shock compression ratio, which gives a flatter non-thermal spectrum, in combination with a thermal (bremsstrahlung) emission contribution.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">We present high-cadence photometric and low-resolution (R $\sim$ 400--700) optical spectroscopic observations of Type IIP supernova, SN~2018pq, which exploded on the outskirts of the galaxy IC~3896A. The optically thick phase (``plateau'') lasts approximately 97 d, the plateau duration of normal Type IIP supernovae. SN~2018pq has a {\em V}-band absolute magnitude of $-16.42 \pm 0.01$ mag at 50 d, resembles normal-luminous supernova, and the V-band decline rate of 0.42$\pm$0.06 mag 50 d$^{-1}$ during the plateau phase. A steeper decline rate of 11.87$\pm$1.68 mag 100 d$^{-1}$ was observed compared to that of typical Type IIP supernovae during the transition between plateau to nebular phase. We employ detailed radiative transfer spectra modelling, TARDIS, to reveal the photospheric temperature and velocity at two spectral epochs. The well-fitted model spectra indicate SN~2018pq is a spectroscopically normal Type IIP supernova. Semi-analytical light curve modelling suggests the progenitor as a red supergiant star with an ejecta mass of $\sim$11 $M_\odot$ and an initial radius of 424 $R_\odot$. On the contrary, hydrodynamical modelling suggests a higher mass progenitor between 14--16 $M_\odot$.</p>

Five of these flares correlate with sources from the Third Catalog of Fermi-LAT High-Energy Sources (3FHL), while one 'orphan' flare lacks a high-energy (HE; $E > 10$~GeV) source counterpart. Some of these flares reached extreme luminosities of $\mathcal{O}(10^{47}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}})$. No consistent temporal correlation emerged between HE and VHE activity: HE flares preceded, coincided with, or followed VHE emission across sources, with some showing no HE counterpart. Remarkably, 3FHL J0308.4+0408 (NGC 1218) is a Seyfert Type I galaxy, while no object of this class was known as a VHE emitter before.

Both sources expand the limited sample of non-blazar AGN detected at VHE energies. The fact that some weak sources with non-aligned jets and, sometimes, even without any traces of HE activity, could demonstrate very short and powerful VHE flares cannot be easily accounted in many current AGN models and calls for their further development.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a promising probe of the high-redshift Universe, but their detection remains observationally challenging. In this work, we explore the detectability of high-$z$ GRBs by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Using a population synthesis model calibrated to $Swift$ GRB observations, we develop a tool to estimate high-$z$ GRB detection rates for instruments with specific energy bands and sensitivities. Our results indicate that \emph{EP}/WXT could detect $\sim5.1^{+3.4}_{-2.4}$ (with 68\% confidence level) GRBs annually at $z>6$, compared to $\sim0.7^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$ $\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z>6$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. While \emph{EP} cannot independently determine redshifts (requiring optical/near-infrared follow-up), its assumed $\sim30\%$ follow-up efficiency yields $\sim1.5^{+1.0}_{-0.7}$ confirmed $z>6$ GRBs annually. \emph{SVOM}, equipped with dedicated follow-up telescopes, will promptly identify high-$z$ candidates deserving deep near-infrared spectroscopy to ensure robust confirmation of high-$z$ GRBs. We anticipate that \emph{EP} and \emph{SVOM} will open new avenues for utilizing enlarged samples of high-$z$ GRBs to explore the early Universe. Moreover, \emph{EP} will assemble a substantial sample of soft, low-luminosity GRBs at low-to-intermediate redshifts, providing critical insights into the structure of GRB jets.</p>

In this work, we explore the detectability of high-$z$ GRBs by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Using a population synthesis model calibrated to $Swift$ GRB observations, we develop a tool to estimate high-$z$ GRB detection rates for instruments with specific energy bands and sensitivities. Our results indicate that \emph{EP}/WXT could detect $\sim5.1^{+3.4}_{-2.4}$ (with 68\% confidence level) GRBs annually at $z>6$, compared to $\sim0.7^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$ $\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z>6$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. While \emph{EP} cannot independently determine redshifts (requiring optical/near-infrared follow-up), its assumed $\sim30\%$ follow-up efficiency yields $\sim1.5^{+1.0}_{-0.7}$ confirmed $z>6$ GRBs annually. \emph{SVOM}, equipped with dedicated follow-up telescopes, will promptly identify high-$z$ candidates deserving deep near-infrared spectroscopy to ensure robust confirmation of high-$z$ GRBs. We anticipate that \emph{EP} and \emph{SVOM} will open new avenues for utilizing enlarged samples of high-$z$ GRBs to explore the early Universe. Moreover, \emph{EP} will assemble a substantial sample of soft, low-luminosity GRBs at low-to-intermediate redshifts, providing critical insights into the structure of GRB jets.`)" title="Add to Reading List">

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Giant pulses (GPs) occur in high magnetic-field millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and young Crab-like pulsars. Motivated by the fast radio bursts (FRBs) discovered in a globular cluster (GC) in the M81, we undertook baseband observations of PSR J1823$-$3021A, the most active GP emitter in a GC with the MeerKAT UHF band receiver (544-1088 MHz). The steep spectral index of the pulsar yields a GP rate of over 37,000 GPs/hr with $S/N>7$, significantly higher than the 3000 GPs/hr rate detected by Abbate et al. 2020 with the L-band (856-1712 MHz) receiver. Similarly to Abbate et al 2020, we find that the GPs are (1) strongly clustered in 2 particular phases of its rotation, (2) well described by a power-law in terms of energies, (3) typically broadband, and have steep spectral indices of $\approx-3$. Although the integrated pulse profile is not significantly polarised ($<1\%$ linear and $<3\%$ circular), one of the brightest GPs displays notable polarisation of $7\%$ (linear) and $8\%$ (circular). The high-time resolution data reveals the GPs have a range of single-peak and multi-peak morphologies, including GPs with three distinct peaks. For the first time, we measured the temporal scattering of the pulsar using 49 bright, narrow, single-pulse GPs, obtaining a mean value of $5.5\pm0.6$ $μ$s at 1 GHz. The distinct periodicity and low polarisation of GPs differentiate them from typical FRBs, although potential quasi-periodicity substructures in some GPs may suggest a connection to magnetars/FRBs.</p>

Widely separated GW detectors are essential for building samples of well-localized BNS mergers accessible to US-based radio telescopes, with minimum yearly detection rates (assuming the smallest values of the BNS local merger rate) ranging from a few with current GW detectors to hundreds with next-generation GW instruments. Current GW networks limit well-localized detections to $z\lesssim 0.2$, while next-generation GW detectors extend the reach to $z\lesssim 0.8$, encompassing the median redshift of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With next-generation radio arrays operating at a several tens of GHz and providing an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the most sensitive ones available today, short GRB-like jet afterglows can be detected for a large fraction of the considered BNS mergers. At lower radio frequencies, detections with current radio interferometric arrays are feasible, though subject to synchrotron self-absorption effects.

SN 2024rmj reached a peak absolute magnitude of Mg $\approx$ -21.9, placing it at the luminous end of the SLSN-I distribution. The light curve exhibits a pronounced pre-peak bump ($\approx$ 60 d before the main peak) and a post-peak bump ($\approx$ 55 d after the main peak). The bulk of the light curve is otherwise well fit by a magnetar spin-down model, with typical values (spin: $\approx$ 2.1 ms; magnetic field: $\approx$ 6 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ G; ejecta mass: $\approx$ 12 M$_\odot$). The optical spectra exhibit characteristic SLSN-I features and evolution, but with a relatively high velocity of $\approx$ 8,000 km s$^{-1}$ post-peak. Most significantly, we find a clear detection of helium in the NIR spectra at He I $λ$1.083 $μ$m and $λ$2.058 $μ$m, blueshifted by $\approx$ 15,000 km s$^{-1}$ (13 d before peak) and $\approx$ 13,000 km s$^{-1}$ (40 d after peak), indicating that helium is confined to the outermost ejecta; based on these NIR detections, we also identify likely contribution from He I $λ$5876 Å in the optical spectra on a similar range of timescales. This represents the most definitive detection of helium in a bright SLSN-I to date, and indicates that progenitors with a thin helium layer can still explode as SLSNe.</p>

SN 2024rmj reached a peak absolute magnitude of Mg $\approx$ -21.9, placing it at the luminous end of the SLSN-I distribution. The light curve exhibits a pronounced pre-peak bump ($\approx$ 60 d before the main peak) and a post-peak bump ($\approx$ 55 d after the main peak). The bulk of the light curve is otherwise well fit by a magnetar spin-down model, with typical values (spin: $\approx$ 2.1 ms; magnetic field: $\approx$ 6 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ G; ejecta mass: $\approx$ 12 M$_\odot$). The optical spectra exhibit characteristic SLSN-I features and evolution, but with a relatively high velocity of $\approx$ 8,000 km s$^{-1}$ post-peak. Most significantly, we find a clear detection of helium in the NIR spectra at He I $λ$1.083 $μ$m and $λ$2.058 $μ$m, blueshifted by $\approx$ 15,000 km s$^{-1}$ (13 d before peak) and $\approx$ 13,000 km s$^{-1}$ (40 d after peak), indicating that helium is confined to the outermost ejecta; based on these NIR detections, we also identify likely contribution from He I $λ$5876 Å in the optical spectra on a similar range of timescales. This represents the most definitive detection of helium in a bright SLSN-I to date, and indicates that progenitors with a thin helium layer can still explode as SLSNe.`)" title="Add to Reading List">

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Recent studies suggest that the most energetic cosmic rays, exceeding 100 EeV, may primarily consist of $r$-process nuclei. This highlights binary neutron star mergers and collapsars as promising sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Building on these insights, we examine the conditions that facilitate the efficient production of UHE $r$-process nuclei during the prompt radiation (PR), extended emission (EE), and plateau emission phases of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) following neutron star mergers. Our study reveals that jets associated with the PR phase, characterized by typical bulk Lorentz factors ($\gtrsim 400-500$), dissipation radii, and magnetic field strengths, can accelerate $r$-process nuclei to energies $\gtrsim 100$ EeV while preserving them during propagation within the source. Additionally, we investigate the production of HE neutrinos from photomeson and hadronic interactions, as well as from the $β$ decay of accelerated $r$-process nuclei. We find that the HE neutrino fluxes from sGRBs, mainly produced via photomeson interactions, are significantly limited to preserve the accelerated heavy nuclei, leading to lower fluxes than the predictions without allowing for contributions to UHECRs. Our results suggest that sGRBs may potentially contribute to UHECRs during the PR phase and to HE neutrinos during the EE phase$-$a scenario that can be tested by future neutrino observatories.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">The Galactic center region was observed with the XRISM X-ray observatory during the performance verification phase in 2024 and a point-like X-ray source was detected with the X-ray imager Xtend at a position of (RA, Dec)=(17h46m10.8s, -29°00'21''), which is thus named XRISM J174610.8-290021. This source was bright in February to March and showed time variations in count rate by more than one order of magnitude in one week. The 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity was ~$10^{35}$ erg/s for the assumed distance of 8 kpc. However, after six months, it was below the detection limit. We found a hint of periodicity of 1537 s from timing analysis. The XRISM/Xtend spectrum has emission lines from helium-like iron (Fe He$α$) at 6.7 keV and hydrogen-like iron (Fe Ly$α$) at 6.97 keV; their intensity ratio is unusual with the latter being four times stronger than the former. If the emission is of thermal origin, the ionization temperature estimated from the iron-line intensity ratio is ~30 keV, which is inconsistent with the electron temperature estimated from the thermal bremsstrahlung, ~7 keV. Spectral models of magnetic cataclysmic variables, which are often seen in the Galactic center in this luminosity range, are found to fail to reproduce the obtained spectrum. By contrast, we found that the spectrum is well reproduced with the models of low-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star plus two narrow Gaussian lines. We consider that the source is intrinsically bright reaching $10^{37}$ erg/s, but is blocked from direct view due to a high inclination and only the scattered emission is visible. The photoionized plasma above the accretion disk with an ionization parameter of ~$10^{5}$ may explain the unusual iron line ratio. We further discuss the potential contribution of point sources of the type of XRISM J174610.8-290021 to the diffuse Galactic center X-ray emission.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Four neutron star radius measurements have already been obtained by modeling the X-ray pulses of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). We report here the radius measurement of PSR J0614-3329 employing the same method with NICER and XMM-Newton data using Bayesian Inference. For all different models tested, including one with unrestricted inclination prior, we retrieve very similar non-antipodal hot regions geometries and radii. For the preferred model, we infer an equatorial radius of $R_{\rm eq}=10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}\,$km for a mass of $M=1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}$ (median values with equal-tailed $68\%$ credible interval), the latter being essentially constrained from radio timing priors obtained by MeerKAT. A more complex model, fitting the data equally well, resulted in a consistent inferred radius. We find that, for all different models, the pulse emission originates from two hot regions, one at the pole and the other at the equator. The resulting radius constraint is consistent with previous X-ray and gravitational wave measurements of neutron stars in the same mass range. Equation of state inferences, including previous NICER and gravitational wave results, slightly soften the equation of state with PSR J0614$-$3329 included and shift the allowed mass-radius region toward lower radii by $\sim 300\,$m, which is compatible with previous analyses to within less than one standard deviation.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are one of the most common subclasses of thermonuclear supernova and yet their sample size, particularly those observed shortly after explosion, remains relatively small. In this paper we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two SNe Iax discovered shortly after explosion, SN 2024bfu and SN 2025qe. Both SNe were observed by multiple all-sky surveys, enabling tight constraints on the moment of first light and the shape of the early light curve. Our observations of SN 2025qe begin <2d after the estimated time of first light and represent some of the earliest observations of any SN Iax. Spectra show features consistent with carbon absorption throughout the evolution of SN 2025qe, potentially indicating the presence of unburned material throughout the ejecta. We gather a sample of SNe Iax observed by ATLAS, GOTO, and ZTF shortly after explosion and measure their rise times and early light curve power-law rise indices. We compare our results to a sample of normal SNe Ia and find indications that SNe Iax show systematically shorter rise times, consistent with previous work. We also find some indication that SNe Iax show systematically lower rise indices than normal SNe Ia. The low rise indices observed among SNe Iax are qualitatively consistent with extended $^{56}$Ni distributions and more thoroughly-mixed ejecta compared to normal SNe Ia, similar to predictions from pure deflagration explosions.</p>
