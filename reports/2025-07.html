                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">While decades of observations in the TeV gamma-ray band have revealed more than 200~sources with radio or X-ray counterparts, there remain dozens of unidentified TeV sources, which may provide crucial information of cosmic ray (CR) accelerators. HESS J1626$-$490 is an unidentified TeV gamma-ray source but is expected to originate from CRs that escaped from the nearby supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and are interacting with dense interstellar clouds. To test this scenario, we scrutinize the properties of the SNR and search for non-thermal counterparts by analyzing observational data in the radio, X-ray, and GeV gamma-ray bands. From analysis of the H\,{\sc i} and $^{12}$CO ($J{=}1{-}0$) line data, we identify the cloud associated with the SNR and compare the morphologies of the cloud and the gamma-ray emission. The distance and age of the SNR are estimated to be $3.3 \pm 0.6$~kpc and ${\sim}5$~kyr, respectively. From X-ray and GeV gamma-ray data analyses, we find an extended GeV gamma-ray emission overlapping with the SNR and H.E.S.S. source regions but no X-ray emission. The location of the peak of the extended GeV emission changes from near the SNR at $\lesssim 1$~GeV to the H.E.S.S. source at $>10$~GeV. We find a spectral hardening at ${\sim}50$~GeV, which is consistent with the existence of two components in the gamma-ray emission. We find that a combination of emission from the escaped CRs and the SNR itself can reproduce the observed broadband spectrum, on the assumption that the SNR has accelerated protons to ${\gtrsim}100$~TeV in the past.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">We report on the results of a comprehensive analysis of X-ray observations carried out with \textit{Chandra}, \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR B1853+01, located inside the W44 supernova remnant (SNR). Previous X-ray observations unveiled the presence of a fast-moving pulsar, PSR B1853+01, located at the southern edge of the W44 thermal X-ray emission region, as well as an elongated tail structure trailing the pulsar. Our analysis reveals, in addition, the presence of an ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar extending for about 1 \arcmin ($\sim$ 1.0 pc at the distance of 3.2 kpc). At larger scales, the entire PWN seems to be surrounded by a faint, diffuse X-ray emission structure. The southern part of this structure displays the same unusual morphology as the ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar, and extends along $\sim 6$ \arcmin ($\sim$ 5 pc) in the direction of the pulsar proper motion. In this report, a spatially-resolved spectral analysis for the different extended regions around PSR B1853+01 is carried out. For an updated value of the column density of $0.65_{+0.46}^{-0.42} \times 10^{22} ~\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, a power-law fit to the ``outflow'' region yields a spectral index $Γ\approx 1.24_{+0.23}^{-0.24}$, which is significantly harder than that of the pulsar ($Γ\approx 1.87_{+0.48}^{-0.43}$) and the pulsar tail ($Γ\approx 2.01_{+0.39}^{-0.38}$). We argue that both the ``outflow'' structure and the surrounding halo-like X-ray emission might be produced by high-energy particles escaping the PWN around PSR B1853+01, a scenario recently suggested also for other Bow-shock PWNe with jet-like structures and/or TeV halos.</p>

We relied on templates to model the diffuse emissions (the Galactic center ridge and the foreground component) and on a 3D likelihood fitting approach. We first assessed the validity of a continuous injection scenario near the Galactic center by investigating possible deviations from a 1/r profile of the cosmic-ray distribution and potential spectral variations within the Galactic center ridge. We found the data can appropriately be described by a scenario in which a steady source near the Galactic center continuously injects cosmic rays which diffuse through the Central Molecular Zone. We then derived the best-fit spectral parameters of the Galactic center ridge emission and we found a spectral transition near 10-20 TeV.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT ~ 0.15 keV, mildly under-solar N and O abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3. According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kyr old and lies at a distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinct "Clump" region shows hard emission equally well described by a thermal (kT ~ 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma ~ 2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Halpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">We present an analysis of new multi-wavelength observations of the TeV gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057, conducted using SALT, Swift, NuSTAR, and VERITAS in 2023--2024. By combining these new data with archival observations, we confirm previous suggestions of orbital variability in the source's X-ray spectrum, including increased X-ray absorption at the orbital phase interval of $φ\approx0.3\textrm{--}0.4$. The source's X-ray flux within this phase interval seems to have exhibited a significant change on an orbital timescale. Additionally, occasional short-term variations in the X-ray band on a timescale of less than 3 days have been observed. The measured duration of the increased absorbing column density and the flux variability timescales can provide clues about the interaction between the putative pulsar and the Be companion's disk if, as previously suggested, the pulsar crosses the disk at this phase interval. Moreover, the new contemporaneous X-ray and TeV observations around the pulsar-crossing phases revealed independent variability in the X-ray and TeV fluxes, contrary to a previous observation of concurrent flux increases. While these observations alone cannot provide definitive conclusions, we discuss our results in the context of pulsar-disk interaction and intrabinary shock emission scenarios.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">We report the detection of GeV gamma-ray emission likely associated with supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and the finding of a molecular cloud ($\sim20$--$30^\prime$ in angular size) that is very likely in physical contact with the SNR and responsible for the gamma-ray emission. Using the 16.8 yr Fermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $σ$ and a radius 0.24° in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the adjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular clump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was revealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found located in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at $-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the position-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests that the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the stellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\gtrsim 15 M_{\mathrm{sun}}$. The giant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated SNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI absorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the radiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the evolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission reported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between the accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large molecular clump.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic, extremely short-lived bursts of radio flashes. Despite extensive research, the exact cause of these outbursts remains speculative. The high luminosity, short duration, and high dispersion measure of these events suggest they result from extreme, high-energy extragalactic sources, such as highly magnetized and rapidly spinning neutron stars known as magnetars. The number of detected FRBs, including repeating ones, has grown rapidly in recent years. Except for FRB 20200428D, and FRB-like radio burst that is associated to Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, no multi-wavelength counterpart to any FRB has been detected yet. The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescope has developed a {program} to follow up FRBs searching for their gamma-ray counterparts, helping to uncover the nature of FRBs and FRB sources. This paper provides an overview of the searches for FRB sources conducted by H.E.S.S., including follow-up observations and simultaneous multi-wavelength campaigns with radio and X-ray observatories. Among the FRB sources observed by H.E.S.S., nine are localized with redshifts ranging between 0.11 and 0.492 from 2015 to 2022. No significant very high energy (VHE) emission was detected during these observations. We report constraints on the VHE luminosity ranging from $10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$, placing limits on the FRB's region persistent VHE emission and potential FRB afterglow emission across timescales from hours to years.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework. Motivated by GW170817, we create a combined model that relate the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We compute the BNS merger rate by convolving metallicity-dependent star-formation history with population-synthesis predictions, and we sample realistic populations to evaluate their GW and EM observables and joint detection rates. We find that next-generation detectors will typically observe BNS mergers with GW network signal-to-noise ratios of $\sim$ 10 to 20, 90th-percentile sky areas of order $\sim$ 10 deg$^2$, and kilonova $i$-band magnitudes spanning $\sim$ 23 to 33. The variation of the merger rate with respect to the common-envelope efficiency is shown in the GW and EM observables and the resulting multi-messenger detection yield, demonstrating how uncertainties propagate into all stages of joint GW+EM forecasting. Across the models examined, no more than $\sim$ 4% of BNS mergers are detectable simultaneously by a two-Cosmic-Explorer plus one-Einstein-Telescope network and by both Roman (in a $K$-like band) and Rubin ($i$ and $g$ bands). These results show that assumptions underlying the combination of progenitor evolution and source observables will constitute key multi-messenger modeling systematics for inference of astrophysical, nuclear, and fundamental physics from future datasets.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Third-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) will detect hundreds of thousands of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, reaching redshifts beyond $z\sim3$. To fully exploit joint GW and electromagnetic (EM) detections, dedicated strategies and adapted EM facilities are essential. We investigate the role of Integral Field and Multi-Object Spectroscopy (IFS and MOS) with the Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) on next generation GW multi-messenger (MM) observations. We consider simulations of BNS populations, their GW detections with ET(+CE), and their EM counterparts: kilonovae (KNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We consider two strategies: one in synergy with wide-field photometric surveys, and a galaxy-targeted one exploiting WST high multiplexing. We estimate the number of galaxies in GW error volumes, and identify observational challenges and mitigation strategies. We find that WST can detect KNe up to $z\sim0.4$ and $m_{\mathrm{AB}}\sim25$, and GRB afterglows beyond $z>1$ for $Θ_{\mathrm{view}}\lesssim15^\circ$. KN observations are best scheduled 12-24 hours post-merger. For poorly localised GRBs, WST IFS can aid the identification. Mini-IFUs and galaxy catalogues complete to $z\leq0.5$ are key to EM counterpart detection. Even at low $z$, the number of galaxies can be huge-thousands at $z<0.1$, tens of thousands at $z<0.2$. Events at $z<0.3$ with localisation $<10$deg$^{2}$ are golden cases for WST, requiring few exposures to target all galaxies. Detecting and characterising EM counterparts of BNS detected in the extended volume explored by next-generation interferometers will be challenging. We show that high-sensitivity, wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic facilities are powerful instruments to fully exploit the new multi-messenger science opportunities enabled by next generation GW detectors.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Short gamma-ray bursts are expected to be associated with compact object mergers, such as binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole systems, and are key high-energy multimessenger events. The detection of GRB 170817A, coinciding with the gravitational wave signal GW170817 from a BNS merger, confirmed the link between sGRBs and compact object mergers. Similarly, GRB 150101B displayed remarkable similarities to GRB 170817A, further supporting its association with compact binary mergers. The objective of this study is to uncover the intrinsic properties that differentiate merger-associated sGRBs from other GRBs by analyzing the Fermi GBM Burst Catalog and using GRB 170817A and GRB 150101B as reference events, enhancing our ability to select events from this class and promptly to search for their electromagnetic counterpart. We employed a clustering technique to classify GRBs based on their observed properties in gamma-rays (T90, Epeak and fluence). Prior to clustering, we tested three dimensionality reduction techniques, among which Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection demonstrated the best performance making it the preferred technique for our analysis. This combination of dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis allowed us to group GRBs with similar characteristics, with a focus on identifying those most likely associated with BNS mergers. Our analysis successfully identified a cluster of sGRBs events with characteristics consistent with sGRB merger-associated. A comparison between our sample of candidates and known kilonova candidates associated with sGRBs, identified through other methodologies, further validated our approach.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">We have reprocessed the data archived from the Parkes 70-cm pulsar (PKS70) survey with an expanded DM search range and an acceleration search. Our goal was to detect pulsars that might have been missed in the original survey processing. Of the original 43842 pointings, 34869 pointings were archived, along with 440 additional pointings for confirmation or timing. We processed all of these archived data and detected 359 known pulsars: 265 of these were detected in the original survey, while an additional 94 currently known pulsars were detected in our reprocessing. A few among those 94 pulsars are highly accelerated binary pulsars. Furthermore, we detected 5 more pulsars with DMs higher than the original survey thresholds, as well as 6 more pulsars below the nominal survey sensitivity threshold (from the original survey beams with longer integrations). We missed detection of 33 (of the 298) pulsars detected in the original survey, in part because portions of the survey data were missing in the archive and our early stage candidate sifting method. We discovered one new pulsar in the re-analysis, PSR J0540$-$69 which has a spin period of 0.909 s and resides in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This new pulsar appeared in three PKS70 beams and one additional L-band observation that targeted the LMC pulsar PSR B0540$-$69. The numerous pulsar detections found in our re-analysis and the discovery of a new pulsar in the LMC highlight the value of conducting multiple searches through pulsar datasets.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">The inevitable fate of massive stars in the initial mass range of ~8--30 M_{Sun} in the red supergiant (RSG) phase is a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion, although some stars may collapse directly to a black hole. We know that this is the case, since RSGs have been directly identified and characterized for a number of supernovae (SNe) in pre-explosion archival optical and infrared images. RSGs likely all have some amount of circumstellar matter (CSM), through nominal mass loss, although evidence exists that some RSGs must experience enhanced mass loss during their lifetimes. The SNe from RSGs are hydrogen-rich Type II-Plateau (II-P), and SNe II-P at the low end of the luminosity range tend to arise from low-luminosity RSGs. The typical spectral energy distribution (SED) for such RSGs can generally be fit with a cool photospheric model, whereas the more luminous RSG progenitors of more luminous SNe II-P tend to require a greater quantity of dust in their CSM to account for their SEDs. The SN II-P progenitor luminosity range is log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 4.0--5.2. The fact RSGs are known up to log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 5.7 leads to the so-called ``RSG problem'', which may, in the end, be a result of small number of available statistics to date.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Millisecond pulsars are known to show complex radio pulse profiles and polarisation position angle evolution with rotational phase. Small scale surface magnetic fields and multipolar components are believed to be responsible for this complexity due to the radiation mechanisms occurring close to the stellar surface but within the relatively small light-cylinder compared to the stellar radius. In this work, we use the latest NICER phase aligned thermal X-ray pulse profile of PSR~J0740+6620 combined with radio and $γ$-ray pulse profiles and radio polarisation to deduce the best magnetic field configuration that can simultaneously reproduce the light-curves in these respective bands. We assume a polar cap model for the radio emission and use the rotating vector model for the associated polarisation, a striped wind model for the $γ$-ray light-curves and rely on the NICER collaboration results for the hot spot geometry. We demonstrate that an almost centred dipole can account for the hot spot location with a magnetic obliquity of $α\approx 51 °$ and a line of sight inclination angle of $ζ\approx 82 °$. However, with this geometry, the hot spot areas are three times too large. We found a better solution consisting of two dipoles located just below the surface in approximately antipodal positions. Our double dipole model is able to reproduce all the salient radio and $γ$-ray characteristics of PSR~J0740+6620 including radio polarisation data. A double dipole solution is more flexible than an off-centred dipole because of two independent magnetic axes and could hint at a magnetic field mostly concentrated within the crust and not in the core.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful transient objects in the Universe, and they are a primary target for the MAGIC Collaboration. Recognizing the challenges of observing these elusive objects with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), we implemented a dedicated observational strategy that included an automated procedure for rapid re-pointing to transient sources. Since 2013, this automated procedure has enabled MAGIC to observe GRBs at a rate of approximately ten per year, which led to the successful detection of two GRBs at very high energies (VHE; E > 100 GeV). We present a comprehensive analysis of 42 non-detected GRBs (4 short GRBs) observed by MAGIC from 2013 to 2019. We derived upper limits (ULs) on the observed energy flux as well as on the intrinsic energy flux corrected for absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL) from the MAGIC observations in selected energy and time intervals. We conducted a comprehensive study of their properties to investigate the reasons for these non-detections, including the possible peculiar properties of TeV-detected GRBs. We find that strong EBL absorption significantly hinders TeV detection for the majority of GRBs in our sample. For a subset of 6 GRBs with redshift z < 2, we compared the UL on the intrinsic flux in the VHE domain with the simultaneous X-ray flux, which is observed to be at the same level in the current population of TeV-detected GRBs. Based on these inferred MAGIC ULs, we conclude that a VHE component with a luminosity comparable to the simultaneously observed X-ray luminosity cannot be ruled out for this sample.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">After nearly a decade in quiescence, the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17511$-$3057 displayed a new outburst on 2025 February 11, its third since discovery, following previous activity in 2009 and 2015. We report on an XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity observation performed on 2025 March 4, more than twenty days after the outburst onset. From the X-ray spectrum - well described by an absorbed Comptonization model - we estimated an unabsorbed 0.5$-$10 keV luminosity of $L_X \sim 7 \times 10^{33} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ (assuming a source distance equal to the upper limit of $6.9$ kpc). To place this in context, we analyzed an archival Chandra observation performed in 2019, which yielded a quiescent luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X,q} \sim 2 \times 10^{32} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ in the same energy band. Although this comparison indicates that the source was still well above its quiescent level during the XMM-Newton observation, the estimated low luminosity during the late stage of the 2025 outburst would typically place the source in the propeller regime. Nevertheless, we unexpectedly detected coherent X-ray pulsations with an amplitude peaking at $\sim$42% in the 0.3$-$3 keV band. We also observed a spectral softening compared to the early stages of the outburst. Finally, we report a 3$σ$ upper limit of 60 $μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$ on the source flux density at 5.5 GHz from ATCA observations acquired on 2025 April 12, following a decline of the accretion activity, as indicated by our analysis of NICER data from 2025 March 15, which revealed no significant X-ray pulsations at a luminosity level of $L_X \sim 1 \times 10^{34} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$. We discuss our findings in the context of other accreting millisecond pulsars and draw comparisons with transitional systems in the sub-luminous disk state.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">Measuring the merger rate density history of binary neutron stars (BNS) can greatly aid in understanding the history of heavy element formation in the Universe. Currently, second-generation Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors can only measure the BNS merger rate density history at low redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 0.1). Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) may trace the BNS merger to higher redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 3). However, not all BNS mergers result in sGRBs, and it is not certain that all sGRBs originate from BNS mergers. In this study, we simultaneously utilize simulated BNS merger GW signals detected by the advanced LIGO design and sGRB signals detected by {\it Fermi}/GBM to constrain the BNS merger rate density history up to $z$ $\sim$ 3. The results indicate that with $\sim$ 8 GWs and 571 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured with an accuracy of about 50\% through $z=0$ to $z=1$. The ratio of the jet opening angle-corrected sGRB event rate density to the BNS merger rate density, denoted as $η$, can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 45\%. With $\sim$ 21 GWs and 761 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured to approximately 35\% and 40\% at $z=0$ and $z=1$, respectively. Meanwhile, $η$ can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 28\%. Additionally, in our parameterized simulation, we find that at least approximately $\sim$550 sGRBs are needed to constrain the characteristic delay time in the star formation rate model, given a relative error of 50\% in the estimated redshift.</p>

Such observations have now established that the ``local'' foreground is made of the solar wind charge exchange and the local bubble, and the background emission is from the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way and from the unresolved extragalactic sources. New data and careful analyses of the SDXB led to two new discoveries in recent years: (1) excess emission near 0.5 keV that is identified as the NVII emission line, and (2) excess emission near 0.8-1.0 keV that is identified with an additional, super-virial temperature hot thermal component of the CGM. The goal of this paper is to use Suzaku shadow observations along six sightlines to determine whether either of these components is from the ``local'' sources. We eliminate the ambiguity regarding the origin of NVII emission, ruling out the local origin. We confirm that the Milky Way CGM contains nitrogen-rich plasma, with a super-solar average (N/O) of 2.6+-0.5, and suggest that nitrogen-enhanced plasma is widespread throughout the CGM. We find super-solar Ne abundance in two sighlines, also from the CGM. Similarly, we rule out the local origin of the hot thermal component and confirm that it is present beyond the shadowing clouds. Furthermore, we provide a revised model of the soft diffuse X-ray background, which is crucial for extragalactic astronomy.</p>

But only one has been visible: PSR J0737$-$3039; and its component pulsar B has now rotated out of sight due to the general-relativistic effect of geodetic precession. We know, though, that these precession cycles can also pivot pulsars into sight, and that this precession occurs at similar strength in PSR J1906+0746. That source is a young, unrecycled radio pulsar, orbiting a compact object with mass $\sim $1.32 M$_{\odot}$. This work presents a renewed campaign to detect radio pulsations from this companion, two decades after the previous search. Two key reasons driving this reattempt are the possibility that the companion radio beam has since precessed into our line of sight, and the improved sensitivity now offered by the FAST radio telescope. In 28 deep observations, we did not detect a credible companion pulsar signal. After comparing the possible scenarios, we conclude the companion is still most likely a pulsar that is not pointing at us. We next present estimates for the sky covered by such systems throughout their precession cycle. We find that for most system geometries, the all-time beaming fraction is unity, i.e., observers in any direction can see the system at some point. We conclude it is still likely that PSR J1906+0746 will be visible as a double pulsar in the future.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">We present panchromatic 0.4-21 microns observations of the nearby (about 7.2 Mpc) Type II supernova 2024ggi, obtained during the plateau phase at about 55 d past explosion. Our dataset includes JWST spectra spanning 1.7-14 microns, MIR imaging at 7.7 and 21 microns, and near-simultaneous ground-based optical and NIR spectra covering 0.32-1.8 microns. The NIR and MIR spectral features of SN 2024ggi are dominated by HI emission. We present line IDs and a toy PHOENIX/1D model that reproduces the observations well, especially the continuum redward of 0.9 microns We compare SN 2024ggi to SN 2022acko and SN 2023ixf, two other Type II supernovae that were also observed by JWST, and highlight key similarities and differences in their spectral features. No evidence for a MIR excess or dust is found at these epochs, with the model matching the observed flux out to 21 microns. We discuss the model's shortcomings, focusing on the density profile, which suppresses line blanketing and produces features in the optical that are too narrow. Our results show the power of panchromatic studies in both exploring the nature of the SN ejecta and constraining detailed models of SNe.</p>

Our dataset includes JWST spectra spanning 1.7-14 microns, MIR imaging at 7.7 and 21 microns, and near-simultaneous ground-based optical and NIR spectra covering 0.32-1.8 microns. The NIR and MIR spectral features of SN 2024ggi are dominated by HI emission. We present line IDs and a toy PHOENIX/1D model that reproduces the observations well, especially the continuum redward of 0.9 microns We compare SN 2024ggi to SN 2022acko and SN 2023ixf, two other Type II supernovae that were also observed by JWST, and highlight key similarities and differences in their spectral features. No evidence for a MIR excess or dust is found at these epochs, with the model matching the observed flux out to 21 microns. We discuss the model's shortcomings, focusing on the density profile, which suppresses line blanketing and produces features in the optical that are too narrow. Our results show the power of panchromatic studies in both exploring the nature of the SN ejecta and constraining detailed models of SNe.`)" title="Add to Reading List">

                <p style="margin-top: 5px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">The Pierre Auger Observatory has published properties of the 100 highest-energy cosmic ray events (to energies above 100 EeV) which it recorded over a 17 year period. We have examined the directional properties of these events and have taken particular note of the most energetically extreme events. We find that the most energetic events have directions which are grouped in a non-random way at the 1\% level. There is an apparent clustering in a limited region of the sky. Close to that direction is found Centaurus A, which has long been considered as a source of such particles, but we also note that a close-by dwarf galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is closer in angular terms. We examine the possibility that the LMC might be a source of observed cosmic rays at the highest energies.</p>
